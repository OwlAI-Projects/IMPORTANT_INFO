# Description of OwlAI project 


OwlAI is an open source AI/LLM project, made (for now) by a little team of developers.
The project isn't really clear, but we'll see what we'll make.
At the beginning, we will only have the Python model training on GitHub, and after, we will make a web chat app.

# Is there a license?

Yes, there's a license that we made ourselves because the others already in GitHub weren't fitting with our conditions.
